# Destiny Lines

**Destiny Lines** is an experimental project created to learn **vibe coding** — using AI tools to rapidly design, prototype, and iterate on application ideas.

The project explores how AI can be used as a **development accelerator**, focusing on ideation, UI flow design, prompt creation, optimization, and troubleshooting rather than traditional model training or backend complexity.

At its current stage, the project consists of **UI designs and a fully defined application concept**.

---

## Project Goal

The main goal of Destiny Lines is to learn how to:
- Build app ideas efficiently using AI-assisted workflows
- Design believable AI-like interactions without real AI inference
- Optimize prompts, logic, and user flow
- Troubleshoot and refine AI-generated code and designs
- Understand how users perceive “intelligent” systems

This project is intentionally focused on **process and tooling**, not advanced AI engineering.

## Concept Overview

Destiny Lines is designed as a **prophecy-style interactive app** that simulates palm reading.

### Planned User Flow
1. User is prompted to “scan” their palm
2. A **fake loading / scanning screen** simulates analysis
3. User selects a topic (e.g., wealth, relationships, career)
4. The app displays a prediction related to the selected topic

The experience is designed to **feel intelligent**, even though no real analysis is performed.

---

## How the System Works (Planned)

- Each topic contains a library of **pre-written prompts**
- When a topic is selected, the app randomly selects one response
- Large prompt pools (50–100 per topic) reduce repetition
- Output is deterministic but **appears generative to the user**

There is **no real AI inference** at this stage. The “intelligence” is intentionally simulated through UX, structure, and controlled randomness.

---

## Current Status

- Application concept fully defined
- Multiple UI screens designed in **Figma**
- User flow and interaction logic planned
- Prompt-based response system designed (not yet implemented)

---

## Technologies (Planned)

- Design: Figma
- Target Platform: iOS
- Development Environment: Cursor (AI-assisted IDE)
- Language / Framework: To be determined (research phase)
- Development Approach:
  - AI-assisted coding
  - Rapid prototyping
  - Iterative debugging and optimization using AI tools
---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Ability to use AI tools to move from idea → design → prototype
- Understanding of AI limitations and appropriate use cases
- Prompt engineering and content structuring
- UX design choices that influence perceived intelligence
- Willingness to experiment, iterate, and refine

---

## Planned Improvements

- Implementation of prompt libraries (50–100 responses per topic)
- Weighted randomness to improve response variety
- UI animations for loading and transitions
- Optional replacement of simulated logic with real AI APIs
- Performance and UX optimization
